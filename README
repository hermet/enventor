[Enventor v0.7.0]
 
This is an EDC editor with some convenient functions. It was started near the begining of June 2013, so expecting it to do everything a mature script editor does is a bit premature.  However, considering its young age, it does a lot.
 
 
[Requirements]
  
  efl (>= 1.16.0)
  elementary (>= 1.16.0)
  
Please note that some features may not quite function correctly or completely prior to EFL 1.16. Newer would be better.
  
Please see the following sites for more information.

[Compiling]
 
Once you have met the requirements, compiling and installing is simple:
 
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
  $ sudo ldconfig (it may need on Linux System)
